# Introduction

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project, where I delve into the Polish data job market in the 2023 with a focus on data analyst roles. This project is a personal exploration into identifying the top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and the intersection of high demand with high salary in the field of data analytics. This project served as the capstone assignment for my data analytics course, allowing me to apply all the key SQL concepts learned.

Check out my SQL queries here: [SQL Queries](./project_sql)

### **Background**

The motivation behind this project stemmed from my desire to understand the data analyst job market better. I aimed to discover which skills are paid the most and in demand, making my job search more targeted and effective. 

The data for this analysis is from the ([Luke Barousseâ€™s SQL Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql)). This data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. 

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for a data analyst looking to maximize job market value?

### **Tools I Used**

In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.

# The Analysis

### **1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs**

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on the Polish job market. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date, 
  company_dim.name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND job_location LIKE '%Poland%'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023 in Poland, based on your query:

WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT	
        job_id,
        job_title,
        job_location,
        salary_year_avg,
        salary_hour_avg,
        company_dim.name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
        LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
            job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
        AND job_location LIKE '%Poland%'
        AND (salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL or salary_hour_avg IS NOT NULL)
)
SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
